# gpt-image2-ppt-skills

**Generate design-forward, highly polished PPT decks with OpenAI `gpt-image-2` in one shot.**

Works natively in Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, and any other Skill-compatible agent. Once installed in your agent, a single natural-language prompt yields 16:9 high-res images + a ready-to-send `.pptx` — or clones any reference `.pptx` template and reskins it with new content.

**Possibly one of the best-looking AI PPT Skills available today.** Instead of filling text into traditional templates, it uses the visual taste, composition, and layout strengths of `gpt-image-2` to generate each slide as a complete visual composition, aiming for decks that look polished, consistent, and presentation-ready from cover to inner pages.

The project also includes dedicated optimization for editing image-based PPTs. You can describe the target slide and element in natural language, and the system regenerates that slide through image-to-image editing while trying to preserve the original style and layout. One important caveat: the background and text in these PPTs are full-slide images. If your workflow depends on manually editing native PowerPoint text boxes and individual objects, this may not be the right fit.

## ✨ What it does

- 🎨 **10 curated styles + an expanded style library** — built-ins include Spatial Glass / Tech Blue / Editorial Mono / Dark Aurora / Risograph / Wabi / Swiss Grid / Hand Sketch / Y2K Chrome / Vector Illustration; on 2026-05-26, 22 additional high-quality styles were selected from 500+ publicly available PPT templates
- 🪄 **Template-clone mode** — drop in any `.pptx`; the agent follows its layout, palette, and illustration language, then swaps in your new content
- 🎯 **Precise natural-language edits** — say "change slide 3's subtitle", "remove the footer", or "replace these three metrics"; the agent regenerates only the target slide through image-to-image editing while trying to preserve the original style and layout
- 🎮 **Dual output** — high-res PNG per slide + 16:9 `.pptx` ready to use
- ⚡ **10-way concurrency by default** — a 10-page deck finishes in ~30s
- 🧪 **Preview one slide first** — approve the cover before generating the full deck
- 🧾 **Trackable edits** — changed slides and generated versions can be traced and rolled back

## ✅ Best-fit use cases

| Use case | Fit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate a new deck from a topic | Strong | Good for reports, pitches, training, courses, product intros. |
| Create a new deck from a company template | Strong | Provide a `.pptx`, approve one cover first, then run the full deck. |
| Edit titles, subtitles, dates, footers | Strong | The most stable editing scenario. |
| Update metric cards and key numbers | Good | Works, but every number must be checked before delivery. |
| Modify only one slide in a multi-slide deck | Good | The target slide is regenerated; other slides are left alone. |
| Dense tables, financial reports, legal long copy | Weak | Small text and numbers need strict human review. |

## 🎨 The 10 built-in styles

> Below: the 10 styles each generating one cover under the same topic — "**How to make a PPT with gpt-image-2**". All covers are raw `gpt-image-2` output, no PS.

## 🧬 Expanded style library: 22 new styles added on 2026-05-26

On 2026-05-26, we added 22 high-quality styles selected from 500+ publicly available PPT templates. More styles will continue to be added, and good PPT template or style references are welcome.

## 🧪 Editing Capability Report

If you care about "how reliable are edits in real scenes", see the user-facing case report:

- **[`docs/edit_guide.md`](./edit_guide.md)** — title replacement, date edits, footer removal, metric updates, logo insertion, single-slide edits in a multi-slide deck, current limitations, and a delivery checklist

Summary:

| Capability | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Short text edits | Stable for everyday delivery. |
| Multiple explicit edits | Works best when the user clearly says what should stay unchanged. |
| Metric slides | Works, but numbers must be checked. |
| Small icon / logo insertion | Works for style-matched icons; real brand logos need source assets. |
| Native PowerPoint object editing | Not supported; output PPTX uses full-slide images. |

## 🚀 Install

### Option 1: let your AI install it (recommended)

Paste this prompt into your AI assistant (Claude Code / OpenClaw / Codex / Cursor / Trae / Hermes Agent, or any other agent that supports Skills) and it will handle the install:

```
Please install gpt-image2-ppt-skills for me:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuneYaooo/gpt-image2-ppt-skills/main/docs/install.md
```

The agent will clone the repo, run the install script, ask for an API key only when direct API mode is needed, and tell you to restart.

### Option 2: manual install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JuneYaooo/gpt-image2-ppt-skills.git
cd gpt-image2-ppt-skills
bash install_as_skill.sh --target claude   # Claude Code
# or
bash install_as_skill.sh --target codex    # Codex
```

The script installs the skill into the selected agent directory:

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/gpt-image2-ppt-skills/`
- Codex: `~/.codex/skills/gpt-image2-ppt-skills/`

If you use direct API mode, inject environment variables through your agent
framework instead of writing secrets into the caller project's root `.env`:

- Claude Code: user-level `~/.claude/settings.json`, or project-level `.claude/settings.local.json`
- OpenClaw / custom agents: reference system env vars from `apiKey` / env config
- CI / servers: system env vars, Docker Compose, Kubernetes Secrets, or CI Secrets
- Standalone CLI: set `GPT_IMAGE2_PPT_ENV=/path/to/private.env`, or use the skill install directory `.env` as a fallback

```bash
# Variable names:
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com    # or any OpenAI-compatible relay
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                     # required
GPT_IMAGE_MODEL_NAME=gpt-image-2
GPT_IMAGE_QUALITY=high                    # low / medium / high / auto
```

> In **Codex**, if the current agent has native image generation, use the native path in `SKILL.md` and skip `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
>
> 🔒 **Won't accidentally eat your secrets**: the script only reads the current process env, platform-injected variables, an explicit `GPT_IMAGE2_PPT_ENV`, and the skill install directory `.env` fallback. It does **not** walk up into caller project directories.
>
> 🪄 Template-clone mode additionally needs an executable PPTX renderer: Windows PowerPoint, macOS Keynote, or LibreOffice. Run `python3 scripts/render_template.py --check` first; HarmonyOS / Termux / containers / unusual architectures should not assume Linux aarch64 LibreOffice binaries are runnable.

### Vision analysis for template clone (optional)

In template-clone mode, the skill needs to "see" your `.pptx` template's visual style first. **If your AI assistant is already multimodal** (Claude Code with Claude Opus/Sonnet, Codex with GPT multimodal, etc.), the agent will analyze the visual style directly and generate a `template_profile.json` with `reference_image` to pass to the CLI with `--template-profile`. **No extra configuration needed.**

Only when your agent uses a text-only model (e.g., DeepSeek text model), you'll need the following env vars to use a separate multimodal model for template analysis:

```bash
# Optional: vision analysis for template clone (only needed by text-only agents; skip for multimodal agents)
VISION_BASE_URL=https://your-openai-compatible-relay.example.com/v1
VISION_API_KEY=sk-...
VISION_MODEL_NAME=gemini-3.1-pro-preview   # or gpt-4o / claude-3.5-sonnet, any multimodal SKU
```

> Supports any multimodal model compatible with the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` format (Gemini / GPT-4o / Claude, etc.). Fully decoupled from `gpt-image-2` — switching the vision provider won't affect image generation.

---

## 🛠 How to use inside Claude Code

Once installed, just say it in plain English:

> Use **gpt-image2-ppt** to make a 5-slide deck about **[your topic]**, style = `dark-aurora`.

Template clone, same shape:

> I have a `company-template.pptx` — make a 5-slide deck about **[your topic]** using that template.

Claude will write the `slides_plan`, generate a cover first for you to approve, then run the full deck and hand back the `.pptx` path.

> Prefer to call the CLI yourself instead of going through an agent? See [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) — CLI flags and file layout live there.

This project swaps the image backend from Nano Banana Pro to OpenAI gpt-image-2, rewrites the 3 inherited styles and adds 7 new ones (10 total), and layers on template-clone mode (vision-based style extraction from any user `.pptx`), an md-first authoring flow, automatic `.pptx` packaging, and a codex CLI fallback backend.
